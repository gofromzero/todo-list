# Task: Testing and Quality Assurance

## Description
Implement comprehensive testing strategy including unit tests, component tests, and end-to-end testing. Ensure code quality, browser compatibility, and performance standards are met for production readiness.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Unit tests for utility functions and services (localStorage, date utilities)
- [ ] Component tests for React components using Testing Library
- [ ] Integration tests for todo CRUD workflows
- [ ] Cross-browser testing on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- [ ] Mobile device testing on iOS and Android
- [ ] Performance testing for load times and bundle size
- [ ] Accessibility testing with screen readers and keyboard navigation
- [ ] Notification timing accuracy testing across different browsers

## Technical Details
- Use Vitest for unit testing (Vite-compatible Jest alternative)
- React Testing Library for component testing
- Playwright or Cypress for end-to-end testing
- Mock localStorage and Notification APIs for testing
- Test coverage target: >80% for business logic
- Performance budget: <200KB bundle, <2s load time
- Automated testing pipeline with GitHub Actions (if applicable)

## Dependencies
- [ ] All previous tasks completed (2-7)
- [ ] Complete application functionality available
- [ ] Test frameworks configured in project setup

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8-10 hours
- Parallel: false (requires complete application)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Test suite runs without errors with `npm test`
- [ ] Code coverage meets 80% threshold for core logic
- [ ] All components render and behave correctly in tests
- [ ] Cross-browser compatibility verified manually
- [ ] Performance benchmarks meet success criteria
- [ ] Accessibility audit passes with no critical issues
- [ ] E2E tests cover complete user workflows
- [ ] Documentation includes testing instructions
