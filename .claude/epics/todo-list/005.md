# Task: Notification System

## Description
Implement browser notification system for todo reminders including permission management, notification scheduling, and delivery. This is the most complex technical component requiring careful handling of browser APIs and timing.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] NotificationService class for managing browser notifications
- [ ] Permission request flow with user-friendly messaging
- [ ] Notification scheduling using setTimeout/setInterval
- [ ] Notification content includes todo title and due date info
- [ ] Fallback graceful handling when notifications are blocked
- [ ] Notification click handling to focus on relevant todo
- [ ] Clear scheduled notifications when todos are completed/deleted
- [ ] Persistent notification scheduling across browser sessions

## Technical Details
- Use Notification API with feature detection
- Service Worker integration for persistent scheduling (optional advanced feature)
- Store scheduled notification IDs with todo records
- Implement notification queue for batch processing
- Handle browser lifecycle events (visibility, focus, beforeunload)
- Notification content: "Todo: {title} is due in {time}"
- Click action: window.focus() and scroll to todo item

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 004 completed (date/time management with reminder calculations)
- [ ] Browser notification permission granted by user
- [ ] Todo data model includes reminder scheduling

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 10-12 hours
- Parallel: false (complex integration with multiple systems)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Browser notification permissions properly requested
- [ ] Scheduled reminders fire at correct times (Â±30 seconds)
- [ ] Notifications display todo information clearly
- [ ] Clicking notifications focuses app and highlights todo
- [ ] Graceful fallback when notifications disabled
- [ ] Cleanup scheduled notifications on todo completion
- [ ] Cross-browser testing completed (Chrome, Firefox, Safari)
- [ ] Performance testing with multiple scheduled reminders
