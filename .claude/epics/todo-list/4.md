# Task: Basic UI Components

## Description
Create the core React components for todo management including the main app structure, todo list display, individual todo items, and add todo form. Focus on functionality over styling in this task.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] App component with basic layout and state management
- [ ] TodoList component that renders array of todos
- [ ] TodoItem component with edit/delete/complete functionality
- [ ] AddTodo component with form for creating new todos
- [ ] Inline editing capability for todo titles and descriptions
- [ ] Checkbox toggle for marking todos complete
- [ ] Delete button with confirmation for removing todos
- [ ] Basic keyboard navigation support (Enter, Escape)

## Technical Details
- Use functional components with React hooks
- Implement controlled form inputs for editing
- TodoItem should handle inline editing state internally
- Use conditional rendering for edit/view modes
- Event handlers for form submission, checkbox changes
- Props interfaces defined for all components
- Use React.memo() for performance optimization where appropriate

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 completed (data layer and hooks available)
- [ ] Todo TypeScript interfaces available
- [ ] useTodos custom hook implemented

## Effort Estimate
- Size: L
- Hours: 8-12 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside date/time features)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All components render without errors
- [ ] Todo CRUD operations work through UI
- [ ] Form validation prevents empty todo titles
- [ ] Inline editing saves on blur or Enter key
- [ ] Component props are properly typed
- [ ] Basic accessibility attributes added (aria-labels, roles)
- [ ] Components tested manually in browser
