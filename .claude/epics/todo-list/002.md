# Task: Core Data Layer and Models

## Description
Implement the data layer for todo management including TypeScript interfaces, localStorage service, and custom React hooks for state management. This provides the foundation for all todo CRUD operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Todo TypeScript interface defined with id, title, description, completed, dueDate, reminder fields
- [ ] LocalStorage service class created with CRUD methods (create, read, update, delete, getAll)
- [ ] Custom useLocalStorage hook implemented for React integration
- [ ] useTodos hook created for todo-specific operations
- [ ] Error handling for localStorage quota exceeded and JSON parse errors
- [ ] Data validation utilities for todo objects
- [ ] UUID generation utility for unique todo IDs

## Technical Details
- Todo interface: `{ id: string, title: string, description?: string, completed: boolean, dueDate?: Date, reminderTime?: Date }`
- LocalStorage key: 'todos' with JSON serialization
- Custom hooks use useState and useEffect for synchronization
- Error boundaries for localStorage failures
- Utility functions in src/utils/ for data manipulation
- Type guards for runtime validation

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 001 completed (project setup)
- [ ] UUID library or crypto.randomUUID() browser API

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: false (core dependency for UI components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All interfaces exported from types/todo.ts
- [ ] LocalStorage service tested manually with console
- [ ] Custom hooks properly handle state updates and re-renders
- [ ] Error handling tested with localStorage disabled
- [ ] TypeScript compilation has zero errors
- [ ] Basic unit tests for utility functions
