# Task: Date/Time Management

## Description
Integrate date and time functionality for todo due dates and reminder scheduling. Implement date picker components, date formatting utilities, and reminder time calculations using date-fns library.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] DateTimePicker component for selecting due dates and reminder times
- [ ] Date formatting utilities for display (relative dates, absolute dates)
- [ ] Due date validation (cannot set dates in the past)
- [ ] Reminder time calculation logic (X minutes/hours before due date)
- [ ] Integration with todo data model for dueDate and reminderTime fields
- [ ] Visual indicators for overdue, upcoming, and completed todos
- [ ] Timezone handling for consistent date storage and display

## Technical Details
- Use HTML5 datetime-local input or custom date picker component
- Leverage date-fns for date manipulation and formatting
- Store dates as ISO strings in localStorage for consistency
- Implement date comparison utilities (isOverdue, isUpcoming)
- Visual states: overdue (red), due soon (yellow), normal (default)
- Reminder calculations: 15min, 1hr, 1day before options

## Dependencies
- [ ] Task 3 completed (data layer supports date fields)
- [ ] date-fns library installed and configured
- [ ] Basic UI components available for integration

## Effort Estimate
- Size: M
- Hours: 6-8 hours
- Parallel: true (can work alongside basic UI components)

## Definition of Done
- [ ] Due dates can be set and edited through UI
- [ ] Reminder times can be configured relative to due date
- [ ] Date formatting displays correctly across different locales
- [ ] Overdue todos visually distinct from others
- [ ] Date validation prevents invalid selections
- [ ] Timezone handling works correctly
- [ ] Integration tested with existing todo CRUD operations
