# PRD: todo-list

## Executive Summary

A minimal viable product for personal task management built with React and TypeScript. The application enables individual users to create, edit, and manage personal todos with time-based reminder functionality. Focus is on core functionality with clean, simple user experience.

## Problem Statement

**What problem are we solving?**
Personal task management often gets scattered across multiple tools or forgotten entirely. Users need a simple, focused application to track personal todos with reliable time-based reminders to ensure important tasks aren't missed.

**Why is this important now?**
- Task management tools are often over-complicated with team features
- Simple todo apps lack reliable reminder systems
- Need for focused, distraction-free personal productivity tool

## User Stories

### Primary User Persona
- **Individual user** managing personal tasks
- Needs simple task tracking with time awareness
- Values clean, fast interface over complex features

### Core User Journeys

**Task Creation Flow:**
1. User opens application
2. User creates new todo item
3. User optionally sets due date/time
4. User optionally configures reminder
5. Task appears in main list

**Task Management Flow:**
1. User views todo list
2. User edits existing task details
3. User marks tasks as complete
4. User receives timely reminders

**Reminder Flow:**
1. System tracks tasks with reminder times
2. At specified time, system sends notification
3. User acknowledges and takes action on task

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Core Features:**
- Create todo items with title/description
- Edit existing todo items
- Delete todo items
- Mark todos as complete/incomplete
- Set due dates and times
- Configure reminder notifications
- View all todos in simple list format
- Persist data locally in browser

**User Interactions:**
- Click to create new todo
- Inline editing of todo text
- Checkbox toggle for completion
- Date/time picker for due dates
- Simple notification settings

### Non-Functional Requirements

**Performance:**
- Application loads in <2 seconds
- Smooth interactions with minimal latency
- Efficient local storage operations

**Technical:**
- Built with React and TypeScript
- Responsive design for desktop/mobile
- Modern browser support (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- Local storage for data persistence

**Usability:**
- Intuitive interface requiring no learning curve
- Accessible keyboard navigation
- Clear visual hierarchy

## Success Criteria

**Measurable Outcomes:**
- User can create and manage todos within 30 seconds of first use
- Reminder notifications successfully fire at configured times
- Zero data loss during normal browser usage
- Application functions offline

**Key Metrics:**
- Task completion rate
- Daily active usage
- Reminder accuracy (notifications fire on time)
- User retention (return usage after initial session)

## Constraints & Assumptions

**Technical Limitations:**
- Browser-only (no native mobile app)
- Local storage only (no cloud sync)
- Browser notification permissions required for reminders

**Timeline Constraints:**
- MVP delivery focused on core functionality only
- Advanced features deferred to future iterations

**Assumptions:**
- Users will grant browser notification permissions
- Local storage is sufficient for personal use
- Users primarily work on single device

## Out of Scope

**Explicitly NOT building:**
- Multi-user collaboration
- Cloud synchronization
- Advanced categorization/tagging
- Task dependencies or subtasks
- Time tracking or productivity analytics
- Third-party integrations
- Export/import functionality
- Recurring task patterns
- Task priorities or urgency levels

## Dependencies

**External Dependencies:**
- Browser notification API support
- Local storage API availability
- Modern ES6+ JavaScript support

**Development Dependencies:**
- React framework
- TypeScript compiler
- Date/time handling library (e.g., date-fns)
- Build tooling (Vite/Create React App)

**No Internal Dependencies:**
- Standalone application
- No backend services required
- No external API dependencies
